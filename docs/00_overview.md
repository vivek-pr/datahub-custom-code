# Overview

This repository is bootstrapped with a lightweight governance baseline to ensure consistency, quality, and velocity from day one. The focus is on simple, language-agnostic controls that scale as the codebase grows.

## Scope

- Establish repo governance foundations: documentation, linting, and CI.
- Enforce basic hygiene via pre-commit hooks and CI checks.
- Provide an initial Architectural Decision Record (ADR) for the chosen approach.

## Goals

- Fast, reliable checks that run locally and in CI.
- Low-friction setup with minimal required tooling.
- Clear ownership of decisions via ADRs.

## Non-Goals

- Language-specific app frameworks or runtime code.
- Infra provisioning or deployment pipelines.
- Comprehensive security scanning or policy-as-code (future work).

## Constraints

- Keep dependencies minimal and broadly available on macOS/Linux and CI runners.
- Prefer vendor-neutral tooling (shell, pre-commit, GitHub Actions).
- No external secrets or services required for validation.

## Deliverables

- `docs/00_overview.md`: this scope and constraints overview.
- `docs/decisions.md`: ADR for Approach-1 (governance bootstrap).
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: repository linting and hygiene hooks.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: CI with pre-commit and smoke checks.

## Success Criteria

- CI passes (green) on push/PR.
- ADR recorded and visible in `docs/decisions.md`.
- Pre-commit runs clean locally and in CI.

## Risks & Mitigations

- Tooling drift: Pin hook versions in pre-commit; update periodically.
- Developer friction: Keep hooks fast; document install and usage in `README.md`.
- Overreach early: Limit scope to hygiene and docs; expand incrementally.
